# Static and Low Level services required by pluto even before
#   the container is configured are registered within resources
#   named '/META-INF/pluto.properties'.  These resources are scanned
#   and each one is given the opportunity to provide implementations
#   of the following services:
#
#
#  com.liferay.pluto.driver.container.ApplicationIdResolver -
#          used to resolve servlet context names in different environments.
#          In a Servlet 2.5 world this is directly available at initialization
#          however, in 2.4 and below, it must be resolved.  Unfortunately,
#          different application servers do not all get resolved in the same
#          manner.
