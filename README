This directory contains the source code for the Liferay Plutonium 4.0 project,
the Compatible Implementation (CI) of Jakarta Portlet 4.0. The project can be
built using the maven command:

mvn clean install -Pplutoniumnium

Building with dist-build.xml
============================

A simplified way to build a bundled Plutonium 4.0 distribution is to use the
dist-build.xml Ant build which downloads Tomcat and calls the appropriate Maven
commands to create a distribution with Plutonium embedded in Tomcat. It will also
copy the portlet API jars (source, executable, and javadoc) into the
distribution directory.

See the documentation in dist-build.xml for details on how to run the build.

Once the bundle has been built, you can unpack it and run the RI. There are three 
bundles available in different formats that have the same contents.

plutonium-<version>-bundle.zip
plutonium-<version>-bundle.gz
plutonium-<version>-bundle.bz2

where <version> is equal to '4.0-SNAPSHOT' for a snapshot build or '4.0' for the
release build.

Select the bundle file appropriate for your environment and unpack it to the 
directory of choice. After unpacking, navigate to the directory:

./plutonium-<version>/bin

and run either startup.bat or startup.sh depending on your environment. This
will start Tomcat with the Plutonium application installed.

The application is configured to use port 8080. You can access the application 
with the following URL:

http://localhost:8080/plutonium/portal

Use the credentials plutonium/plutonium to log on to the application.
